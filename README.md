## Installation

### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if it is not installed yet:

$ pod setup
```

Add WAActivityIndicatorView to Podfile:

``` bash
pod 'WAActivityIndicatorView'
```

Call 'pod install':

``` bash
pod install
```

### Manual install

All you need to do is drop WATokenFieldView folder into your project and include headers.

## Example usage

``` swift
        pulseView = WAActivityIndicatorView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: itemSize, width: itemSize, height: itemSize),
                indicatorType: ActivityIndicatorType.Pulse,
                tintColor: UIColor.whiteColor(),
                indicatorSize: itemSize)

        view.addSubview(pulseView)
        
        pulseView.startAnimating()
```

## Type of animation

``` swift
enum ActivityIndicatorType{
    case Pulse
    case ThreeDotsScale
    case DotTriangle
    case GridDots
    
    func animation() -> WAActivityIndicatorProtocol {
        switch self {
        case .Pulse:
            return PulseAnimation();
        case .ThreeDotsScale:
            return ThreeDotsScaleAnimation();
        case .DotTriangle:
            return DotTriangleAnimation();
        case .GridDots:
            return GridDotsAnimation();
        }
    }
